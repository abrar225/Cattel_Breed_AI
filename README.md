# 🐄 BreedAI  
### AI-Powered Indian Cattle Breed Identification System

**BreedAI** is a computer vision–based web application that identifies **41 Indian cattle breeds** from a single image using **Vision Transformer (ViT)** models.  
It is designed for **farmers, researchers, and students** who need quick, assistive breed identification without manual guesswork.

> ⚠️ **BETA:** This system is in active training/testing. Results are assistive, not authoritative.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 📸 Upload or capture cattle images instantly
- 🧠 Powered by **Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16)**
- 🧩 Uses a **Hybrid Ensemble model** for better robustness
- 📊 Transparent training data & performance metrics
- 📱 Fully responsive with camera support
- 📝 Built-in user feedback system

## 🧠 What Problem Does BreedAI Solve?

Identifying Indian cattle breeds is difficult due to:
- High **visual similarity** between breeds  
- Inconsistent real-world image quality  
- Manual identification being time-consuming and error-prone  

Most existing tools either:
- Don’t support Indian breeds properly  
- Hide training data and limitations  
- Overclaim unrealistic accuracy  

**BreedAI takes a different approach — honest, transparent, and practical.**

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. User uploads an image / captures a live photo  
2. Image is resized to **224×224** and normalized  
3. Passed through a **Vision Transformer ensemble**  
4. Model predicts the most likely breed  
5. Confidence score and model details are shown instantly

## 📊 Dataset & Training

- **Total Breeds:** 41  
- **Total Images:** 5,928  
- **Training Epochs:** 30  
- **Validation Accuracy:** **52.45%**  

> 📌 With 41 classes, random guessing yields ~**2.4% accuracy**.  
> Achieving 52.45% in a fine-grained, visually similar dataset is statistically significant.

## 🏋️ Training Challenges

### ⚠️ Dataset Imbalance
Some breeds had fewer than 40 images, while others had 400+.

### 👀 Visual Similarity
Many Indian breeds differ only in subtle physical traits.

### 🌦 Image Quality Variations
Lighting, angles, resolution, and real-world noise affected performance.

### 🖼 Background Clutter
Non-isolated cattle images introduced distractions for the model.

## 💡 Transparency & Limitations

- Predictions depend heavily on image quality
- Some breeds remain difficult to distinguish reliably
- Not suitable for medical, breeding, or legal decisions
- Designed as an **assistive AI tool**, not a final authority

Transparency is a **feature**, not a weakness.
